# Task ID: 22
# Title: Develop Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 14, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to meet the required response time of <2 seconds for standard operations.
# Details:
1. Implement request batching for multiple API calls
2. Use 'p-limit' (npm install p-limit) for concurrency control
3. Optimize database queries in rate limiting module
4. Implement response compression using 'compression' (npm install compression)
5. Use 'fast-json-stringify' (npm install fast-json-stringify) for faster JSON serialization
6. Implement lazy loading for non-critical data

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance profiling using 'clinic' (npm install clinic)
2. Measure response times for all endpoints
3. Test performance under high concurrency
4. Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits
