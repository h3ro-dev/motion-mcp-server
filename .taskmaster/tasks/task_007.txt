# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Recurring Tasks Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement MCP tools for managing recurring tasks, including listing, creating, and deleting recurring task series.
# Details:
1. Extend 'tasks' module to include recurring tasks
2. Implement 'motion_list_recurring_tasks' tool with workspace filtering
3. Create 'motion_create_recurring_task' with support for all frequency patterns
4. Implement 'motion_delete_recurring_task' for removing recurring task series
5. Add support for advanced patterns (specific days, week positions, month days)
6. Use 'rrule' library (npm install rrule) for handling recurring patterns

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each recurring task tool
2. Test creation of tasks with various recurrence patterns
3. Verify proper deletion of recurring task series
4. Integration test with mock API responses
