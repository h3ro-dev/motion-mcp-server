# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Logging and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive logging and monitoring system for the MCP server.
# Details:
1. Use 'winston' for logging (already installed in task 13)
2. Implement different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
3. Create log rotation using 'winston-daily-rotate-file' (npm install winston-daily-rotate-file)
4. Implement request logging using 'morgan' (npm install morgan)
5. Set up application performance monitoring using 'prometheus' (npm install prom-client)
6. Create custom metrics for important operations
7. Implement alerts for critical errors or performance issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify logs are created and rotated correctly
2. Test different log levels
3. Check request logging for accuracy
4. Verify custom metrics are recorded correctly
5. Test alert system with simulated issues
